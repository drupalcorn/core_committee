**Virtual Meeting Service Discussion**

Hof want to not be dependant on a service provided by someone not in core.

Zoom. If provided by a core committee member.

Suggestion Google Hangout. Question on what sort of permissions are around that. Can random people drop in? Hangouts can go public and we can capture and stream. Requires Google+. Provides screen sharing

Skype? Do they provide screen sharing?

**Move to vote on trying Google Hangout for next meeting.**

John - Try Next Meeting

Brandon - Try Next Meeting

Michael - Try Next Meeting

Hans - Pending

Ann - Pending

**Storing Sensitive Information Discussion**

Michael proposes KeePassX on Google Drive. How does Drive app work with shared content?

Michael uses this solution now with KeePassX on Google Drive. He also has the KeePass file available on his Android phone. Write gets locked when first person opens it.  

Question on Google revision on binaries? What happens if DB gets corrupt? Brandon’s experience with Shared KeePass DB hasn’t had issues in over 4 years.

Store in core committee Google drive shared folder.

What is master password or physical key (Michael doesn’t want physical key). If anyone feels 

the password is compromised, anyone in core committee can change it, no approval necessary, just notify. Communicate master password via voice only. What is password requirements? Needs good complexity, but easily communicated by voice. Password is a sentence with punctuation eg. "The Password is Password lol!"

How to work with camp committee? New DB for camp. Sharing EventBrite would give access to funds.

Michael will set up if approved.

**Move to vote on trying Keepass on Google Drive.**

John - Keepass on Core’s Google Drive

Brandon - Keepass on Core’s Google Drive

Michael - Keepass on Core’s Google Drive

**Camp Code of Conduct Discussion**

Last year we referenced the Drupal Code of Conduct. [http://2013.drupalcorn.org/archive/2013/policies.html](http://2013.drupalcorn.org/archive/2013/policies.html)

Florida camp conduct policy is really good and Creative Commons licenced. [https://fldrupalcamp.org/code-conduct](https://fldrupalcamp.org/code-conduct).

Having our own conduct policy is in addition to the Drupal Code of Conduct.

**Move to vote on adopting Florida camp style conduct with revisions and attributes and Drupal Code of Conduct.**

John - Yes

Brandon - Yes

Michael - Yes

Hans - Pending

Ann - Pending

John Proposes new agenda doc spreadsheet to keep track of agenda items. John will make spreadsheet.
