**Training Day Costs - Keep consistent year to year or based on actual costs?**

2015 training day costs/expenses will be low compared to previous years.  Should the camp’s cut of the fees be lowered or keep it consistent? Last year cut was $40? Anticipated $20 cost this year.

**Vote**: DrupalCorn cut of training fee will be based on anticipated per person expense.

**Give anyone with a session accepted for presentation one free admission to the conference?**

30 speakers * $45 = 1350. However a lot of speakers are coming from sponsor tickets. Previously tied tickets to expenses, however we have enough funds to experiment with this.

**Vote**: Each accepted session is provided 1 free attendance ticket. Limit 1 per person.
