Questions from DeWayne to Core asking if we have feedback

Hofmockel: re-enforced marketing plan, taking care of coders on Saturday night.

Ann: happy to see designer, happy to see activities person (Rob), recommend social media schedule (Twitter, etc) 

John: What is plan for annoucement?

Follow from last year. Get website out first.

Biggest Concern from DeWayne: 

	Does he have enough people to get stuff

	Getting website

	Marking down the big details.
