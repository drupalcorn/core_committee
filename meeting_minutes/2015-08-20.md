**Use LastPass for password sync?**

Using keepass is cumbersome with different versions and requiring to sync with a desktop client. It is not generally accessible on mobile.

What are the capabilities of LastPass? Sync, Mobile, web interface, cost, do we want 1 account or multi-user? How to ACL. Are there other products that would solve this issue for us?

LastPass: https://lastpass.com
RatticDB: http://rattic.org

**Vote:** DeWayne will research LastPass and any other solutions that will help us manage our passwords. Will report to core@drupalcorn.org by September 1.

**2015 Review**

Evaluations are in Google Drive /2015/Evaluations.  Will send evals back their own evals to speakers. Attendance really dropped off on Saturday. Attendance Sat was about half of Friday. There are numbers for session attendance somewhere. 

Sponsors want attendees who are their target audience. Expand to non-drupal shops.

Videos are not up yet, still in progress. Contact Rearick for access to YouTube if issues.

Budget. Reimbursements still coming. Campus services will be paid through UNI account and will be billed to DrupalCorn at once. About $500 negative balance. Plenty of T-Shirts, lanyards to go several years.

Need to send money to Training providers. - Get list to HANS

T-shirt sales deposited.

Sponsorships were lower this year. Concern was that D8 was not out.


**2016 Camp**

Marriott on Iowa River Landing is first choice. Not know cost yet.

Website is currently in progress on Genevieve's box. Code and content. Based on CoD. Still need to decide where to host.

Need to flatten the 2015 site after videos are posted. (End of the weekend?)

All the stuff is in CF with DeWayne. DeWayne and Genevieve will coordinate.

Dates: Looking at Aug 11. Avoid RAGBRAI and state fair (Aug 13-23)? Could be pushed to September? Usually students get priority with space on campus.

**Drupalcorn.org DNS**

Drupalcorn.org will expire 9-8-15. Hof has offered to transfer ownership. Would like to get it under drupalcorn ownership.

**Vote:** Create DrupalCorn account on Johnâ€™s preferred Registrar to transfer domain registration ownership for a five year registration under core@drupalcorn.org. Tie it to JamesGang credit card for payment.

Brandon: Yes
DeWayne: Yes
Genevieve: Yes
Rearick: Yes
Hans: YES
Ann: Yes

What to do about flattened archived site hosting. DreamHost might have free shared hosting for non-profits.

Rearick will investigate free hosting solutions for static archived sites.
HANS offers to host gratis on his webspace.
